          <p>Some trees grow faster than others. The typical forest trees, such as
            oak and beech, are rather slow growing compared to birch and alder.
            These can almost be thought of as tree ‘weeds’. They produce huge
            numbers of very small seeds, sometimes with wings, which travel
            considerable distances.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <p>Once on the ground, they grow rapidly and
            begin to produce new seeds as young as five years old. In contrast,
            oak trees produce many fewer seeds, but their acorns contain lots of
            food for the developing seedlings, giving them a good start in life,
            particularly if they find themselves under a canopy of other tress. On
            the other hand, an acorn is not well adapted to travelling long
            distances unless a bird or squirrel carries it off.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="three">
          <p>Once established a
            seedling grows rather slowly and may not produce seeds until it is 20
            or 30 years old. Woods tend, therefore, to be composed of longer-lived
            trees, of which the best example is oak. Over most of Europe the
            vegetation which would occur in the absence of human interference, is
            oakwood of some sort.</p>

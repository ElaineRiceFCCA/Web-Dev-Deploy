          Ireland boasts several native varieties of willow, all thriving in
          moist soil and characterized by their catkins or "pussy willows,"
          which bear seeds and are easily propagated from cuttings due to their
          high rooting propensity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among the most prevalent species are the goat willow, the rusty or
          grey willow (referred to as "sallies"), and the eared willow. While
          typically found in damp environments, the goat willow can also
          establish itself in rough or disturbed terrain in dryer regions.
          Additionally, the bay-leaved willow, distinguished by its glossy green
          foliage, thrives alongside small rivers and ditches.

          Osiers, recognized for their long, slender leaves, do not mature into
          towering trees. Historically, they were cultivated and pruned to the
          base to stimulate the growth of long, flexible shoots utilized in
          basket weaving. Today, this species is often cultivated for biomass
          production, offering a sustainable energy source.

          Willow trees support a diverse insect population, making them an
          essential food source for birds, particularly during the summer
          months, a notable example being the willow warbler.
        </p>

          Interestingly, willow trees have been historically associated with
          healing properties. Willow bark contains a compound called salicin,
          which is similar to aspirin and has been used for centuries to
          alleviate pain and reduce fever.

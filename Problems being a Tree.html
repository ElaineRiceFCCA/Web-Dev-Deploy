          Most trees, grow in woods and not as isolated specimens. The
          magnificent trees that adorn parks are rather exceptional in the tree
          world. Few of their relations will get the chance to expand in all
          directions without coming up against neighbours. So, while the
          parkland tree grows up and out, its woodland counterpart is drawn
          always upward to avoid being overshadowed. The shape of trees
          therefore reflect their way of life. Living in woodlands imposes other
          constraints; the survival of a species involves shedding good seeds
          that grows into new trees. When a seed germinates on the floor of a
          wood, it has little chance of growing steadily to the canopy above as
          there can be too little light. Instead the seedling must wait for a
          tree to fall or die thereby letting in light. You may see many young
          trees a few centimetres tall, but very few more than that. Underneath
          them, growing slowly and more tolerant of the shade, are young beech
          trees.

          After planting a tree, thoroughly soak the soil to ensure that the
          water gets down to the roots.

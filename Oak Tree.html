          The quintessential Irish oak variety is the sessile oak, predominant
          in the country's most iconic woodlands. Often thriving in poor acid
          soils, particularly in hilly regions, these woodlands grace locations
          like Killarney in Co. Kerry, the Glen of the Downs in Co. Wicklow, and
          Glenveagh in Co. Donegal.
        </p>
        <p>
          These oak woodlands serve as vital ecological habitats, supporting a
          plethora of invertebrate species, as well as numerous birds and
          mammals. The term "sessile" denotes that the acorns lack a stalk,
          distinguishing them from the pedunculate oak whose acorns hang from
          lengthy stalks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite once being widespread across Ireland, extensive centuries-old
          harvesting practices, coupled with inadequate tree replacement
          efforts, have rendered truly native oak specimens increasingly rare,
          though remnants can still be found in small woodlands scattered across
          various counties.
        </p>
        <p>
          Semi-natural oak woodlands often feature a mix of birch and ash, with
          hazel, holly, and rowan interspersed throughout the undergrowth. Oaks
          have long been prized for their premium timber, renowned for its
          aesthetic appeal and robustness, making it a favored material for
          furniture production.

          While oak male flowers are inconspicuous catkins that precede the
          emergence of leaves, the seeds-acorns are far more conspicuous. Oak
          trees do not yield a bountiful crop every year, underscoring the value
          of gathering plentiful acorns during favorable seasons.

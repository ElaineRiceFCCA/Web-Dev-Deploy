            Alders, among Ireland's most traditional and widely spread trees,
            thrive in damp habitats, lining the shores of freshwater loughs and
            meandering riverbanks where their robust, fibrous roots aid in soil
            retention.

          <p>
            Notable woodlands can be found in Ross Island, Killarney, County
            Kerry, and the Gearagh, County Cork, while Grantstown Wood, County
            Laois, stands as a rare example of wet woodland on alkaline soil.

            Like many trees, alders bloom before leaf emergence, displaying
            captivating reddish catkins and small cones containing seeds. They
            adapt well to various soil types but particularly favor moist
            environments. Given fertile, damp soil, alders exhibit rapid growth,
            making them highly productive for timber. In ancient Ireland,
            sections of alder trunks served as round shields, later becoming
            prized for crafting clogs and furniture, earning them the nickname
            "Irish mahogany."

          <p>
            Due to its resistance to decay when submerged, alder was used in the
            construction of sluice gates and other water-retaining structures
            along streams, rivers, and canals.

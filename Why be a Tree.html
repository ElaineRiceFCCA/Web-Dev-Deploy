          The chief advantage in being a tree is the amount of light it gets
          simply by being bigger than other plants. The disadvantage of being a
          tree is that it must survive in one place for a long time. If fires,
          landslides, or hurricanes are regular events, the tree may die without
          ever having reproduced. In fact, human activity is the major factor
          militating against them. For example, it is thought that about 10,000
          years ago, 80% of Ireland was covered by woodland, while today it is
          only 11%.

          Co. Wicklow at 202 ft tall.

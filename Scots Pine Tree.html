          Originally, the Scots pine was native to Ireland, as evidenced by
          pollen found in soil samples from bogs, indicating its widespread
          presence thousands of years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, due to human impact and the gradual shift towards a warmer,
          wetter climate, the Scots pine experienced a decline, and there are
          indications that it may have vanished completely from the region.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remarkably, pine stumps dating back 7,000 years have been discovered
          in bogs, standing as remnants of a time before the formation of peat.
          Nowadays, most of the Scots pines scattered across the Irish
          countryside were imported from Scotland and planted within the last
          150 years.

          Efforts have been underway to reintroduce this once-native species, as
          it holds ecological significance. Scots pine can thrive in marginal
          lands where other tree species struggle, and it offers quicker growth
          and more versatile wood compared to broadleaf trees.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite being a coniferous species, Scots pine contributes to
          biodiversity by providing habitat for various wildlife species, even
          as canopy cover changes. Notably, our native red squirrels show a
          preference for the seeds of Scots pine over other options.

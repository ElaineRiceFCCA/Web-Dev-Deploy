          The wych elm, a native species, has seen various introductions and
          plantings of its different varieties, including the smooth-leaved elm,
          primarily for timber purposes, throughout Ireland's history.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wych elm predominantly thrives in the mountainous glens of the
          northwest. Conversely, English elm was extensively cultivated in manor
          lands, yet numerous trees have succumbed to Dutch elm disease in
          recent times.
        </p>
        <p>
          English elms exhibit regrowth from stumps and produce suckers in
          hedgerows, which can serve as propagation material. However, the Irish
          wych elm, demonstrates greater resistance to disease. It does not
          generate suckers and must be cultivated from seed.

          The flowers, akin to several tree species, emerge before the leaves,
          appearing as reddish clusters directly on the twigs. Initially
          inconspicuous, they mature into pale green seeds resembling leaves,
          eventually ripening and falling shortly after the authentic leaves
          emerge.

          Elm wood has been prized for its strength and durability, making it a
          popular choice for furniture, shipbuilding, and even the construction
          of water pipes in ancient Rome. Additionally, elm trees have been
          celebrated in literature and folklore, often symbolizing endurance,
          resilience, and wisdom. For example, in Norse mythology, the elm tree
          is associated with the goddess Frigg, who was believed to inhabit the
          tree and impart her wisdom to those who sought it.

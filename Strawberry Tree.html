          The Arbutus, commonly known as the strawberry tree, is a compact
          evergreen tree that can grow to towering heights of up to 15 meters.
          Its distribution is distinctive, being naturally found in the
          Mediterranean region and select areas of Ireland.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike many native trees that arrived in Ireland via Great Britain,
          the Arbutus is believed to have migrated here across the land bridge
          from Brittany.
        </p>

          Named for its fruit's unique shape and color, the strawberry tree
          predominates in County Kerry, particularly in the Killarney district,
          where it forms a significant part of the natural forest on the islands
          and shores of the lakes. It also thrives in unshaded areas of
          Glengarriff Wood, County Cork, and around Lough Gill in County Sligo.
        </p>
        <p>
          In November and December, the Arbutus bursts into bloom with profuse
          white flowers. Due to the fruit's year-long ripening process, the tree
          often bears both mature fruit and flowers simultaneously.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the fruit is technically edible, its Latin name is Unedo,
          meaning "I eat one" implying it is not particularly enjoyable.

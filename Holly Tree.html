          The native evergreen holly contributes to the shrub layer in our
          oldest woodlands, thriving in environments such as narrow gullies in
          the Sperrins or Donegal uplands, where it endures harsh conditions
          alongside rowan trees.
        </p>
        <p>
          Renowned for its visual appeal, holly is a popular choice for gardens,
          serving as an eye-catching specimen tree or dense hedge, albeit
          slow-growing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Holly trees exhibit sexual dimorphism, with only females bearing the
          iconic berries, making it advisable to plant multiple trees for
          optimal fruiting. Both male and female trees produce small creamy
          flowers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite shedding its spiny leaves year-round, particularly in summer
          heat, holly remains green throughout the year, historically prized
          alongside ivy for Christmas adornments, symbolizing life amidst
          winter's dormancy.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some traditions, cutting down holly is deemed unlucky, leading to
          its preservation as hedgerows.

          The yew tree, a native species, thrives in old woodlands but is also
          commonly found in the cultivated environments of estates and
          churchyards. With its dark foliage and vibrant red berries enveloping
          a single seed, the yew presents a striking presence. Notably,
          Reenadina wood on the Muckross Peninsula, Co. Kerry, stands as
          Ireland’s sole native yew woodland.

          A unique variant of the Irish yew, known as Taxus baccata ‘fastigata’,
          boasts an upright growth pattern and was initially discovered on rocky
          limestone hills in Co. Fermanagh. This variant was later cultivated at
          Florencecourt and subsequently introduced into numerous gardens and
          churchyards. While many yew trees exhibit single-sex characteristics,
          the majority of Irish yews are female, bearing fruit albeit with slow
          germination rates.

          The most viable yew seeds are those consumed by birds and subsequently
          passed through their digestive systems; such exposed seeds can often
          be gathered from beneath yew trees. Additionally, there exist
          ornamental garden varieties of yew, some featuring yellow fruit or
          golden foliage, which are typically propagated through cuttings.

          Yew trees thrive in well-drained sites, preferably sheltered from
          excessive wind and frost. However, it's important to note that both
          the leaves and seeds of yew trees are toxic to most livestock and can
          pose risks to animals and children if planted in areas accessible to
          them. Despite this, yew trees serve as valuable habitats for wildlife,
          with birds frequently roosting and nesting among their branches.

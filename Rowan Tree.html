          Rowan trees bring vibrant hues to woodlands across Ireland,
          particularly in elevated regions where they flourish even amidst rocky
          terrain, earning them the nickname "mountain ash".
        </p>
        <p>
          Their creamy blossoms mature into scarlet berries early in the season,
          offering sustenance to thrushes throughout the winter months.
        </p>

          During winter, a mistle thrush will fiercely defend a rowan tree or
          holly, not for nesting purposes but to safeguard its feeding
          territory.
        </p>

          Rowan trees are prized additions to gardens, thriving in well-drained
          sites while exhibiting adaptability to various soil types.
        </p>
        <p>
          Different components of the rowan tree, such as its bark, berries, and
          leaves, have been utilized in traditional medicine. Rich in vitamin C,
          the berries have been crafted into jams, jellies, and alcoholic
          beverages. Additionally, the bark and leaves were historically
          employed in treating ailments like diarrhea, sore throats, and fevers.

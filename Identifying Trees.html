          The identification of plants can seem a formidable task when you are
          just beginning. The basic rule being, if a botanist has no idea what a
          particular plant is, they will use a key to identify it. In practice
          you can use a book for identification, however, you need to know what
          to look for. Leaves are often good characters, in particulate their
          size, shape and colour, but the most reliable guides are the flowers
          and fruit. However, in winter you may not have leaves or flowers
          available and therefore you must rely on bark or twig characteristics.
